# The GUI of this digital watch program is the least interactive as it will just have one button that will display the current time. 
# Therefore, creating the button and setting it inside the JFrame is all that is needed. To find the current time, the following steps are performed:

1. To get the current time, the Calendar class of Java is used. It is an abstract class containing methods that will return the time, date, year, and month.
2. Once an object of the Calendar class is created, the current time is retrieved using the getDate() method. This clock is designed to be in the 12-hour format.
3. Finally, what is left is formatting the time int hrs:mm:ss. For this, an object of the SimpleDataFormat class is instantiated. The date obtained in the step above is then formatted according to the layout of hrs:mm:ss.
4. The printTime() function simply sets the text of the button to the current time every time it is called. It is called every second, besides which the thread sleeps.
5. The whole body of the code is placed in an Exception Handler in the unforeseen event of a failure.
